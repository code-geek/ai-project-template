First off, thank you for considering contributing to AI Project Template! It's people like you that make this template better for everyone.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible using the issue template.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

1. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-project-template.git
   cd ai-project-template
   ```

2. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   uv tool install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Create a branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Make your changes and test:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh
   ```

5. Commit your changes (pre-commit hooks will run automatically):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"
   ```

   If any hooks fail, fix the issues and commit again.

6. Push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Code Quality

All code is automatically checked by pre-commit hooks:

- **Python**: Ruff for linting/formatting, mypy for type checking
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Biome for linting/formatting
- **Security**: Automatic secret detection
- **General**: YAML/JSON validation, trailing whitespace removal

Run hooks manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

## Claude Code Agents

When contributing new agents:

1. Place them in `.claude/agents/`
2. Use YAML frontmatter with name, description, and tools
3. Focus on a specific expertise area
4. Include practical examples
